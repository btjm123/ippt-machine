## Introduction
IPPT Anywherez is a fully open-source IPPT Machine Tracker for us NSFs and NSMen alike. ~~It is created because we can't pass our IPPT~~ 

It is created **to democratize the motion senors used in ELISS machines for IPPT**

## No more No Counts, Straighten Backs
Gone are the days where you have to travel to Kranji/Maju Camp or book an expensive appointment at True Fitness to evaluate your own physical fitness. 

With **IPPT Anywherez**, you can check your pushups/situps form anywhere, anytime!

## The power of meth
We exploit trigonometry to find the magnitude of the angle between the forearm and bicep from the normalized window coordinates of elbow, shoulder and hand. Following which, we render the real-time angle at the upscaled coordinates (relative to the size of the video capture) of the elbow.
